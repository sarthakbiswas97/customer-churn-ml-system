Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a binary classification model that predicts the probability a telecom customer will churn in the next billing period. The target variable, Churn, indicates whether a customer has discontinued service (Yes) or remained (No). By accurately identifying likely churners, the business can proactively engage them with retention offers, reducing unnecessary outreach costs while still capturing the majority of true churners. This balance is critical for maximizing retention ROI and improving long-term customer value.
